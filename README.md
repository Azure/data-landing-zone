# Getting started

## 1. Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are required to make this repository work:
- At least 1 Azure subscription used as Data Landing Zone which is connected to the Data Management Subscription
- Contributor access to the Azure subscription
If you don’t have an Azure subscription, create a free account before you begin. Try the [free version of Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/free/).

## 2. Create repository from a template
TODO - add screenshots
1. On GitHub Enterprise Server, navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. Above the file list, click **Use this template**
3. Use the **Owner** drop-down menu, and select the account you want to own the repository.
4. Type a name for your repository, and an optional description.
5. Choose a repository visibility. 
6. Optionally, to include the directory structure and files from all branches in the template, and not just the default branch, select **Include all branches**.
7. Click **Create repository from template**.

## 3. Setting up the required secrets

A service principal needs to be generated for authentication and getting access to your Azure subscription. Just go to the Azure Portal to find the details of your resource group or workspace. Then start the Cloud CLI or install the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) on your computer and execute the following command to generate the required credentials:

```sh
# Replace {service-principal-name}, {subscription-id} and {resource-group} with your 
# Azure subscription id and resource group name and any name for your service principle
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name {service-principal-name} \
                         --role contributor \
                         --scopes /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group} \
                         --sdk-auth
```

This will generate the following JSON output:

```sh
{
  "clientId": "<GUID>",
  "clientSecret": "<GUID>",
  "subscriptionId": "<GUID>",
  "tenantId": "<GUID>",
  (...)
}
```

Add this JSON output as [a secret](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets) with the name `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` in your GitHub repository:

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/media/.png" alt="GitHub Template repository" width="700"/>
</p>

To do so, click on the Settings tab in your repository, then click on Secrets and finally add the new secret with the name `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` to your repository.
