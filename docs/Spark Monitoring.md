# Spark Monitoring

> *These are just notes on about the Spark Monitoring application and how the JAR files are loaded.*

* Instead of copying pre-built binaries for the Spark Monitoring solution, the deployment process
includes a step that will download the source code from GitHub and build it.  This creates the JAR
files that are then copied to the DBFS.  This is handled in a notebook that is executed whenever a
new Databricks workspace is provisioned.
